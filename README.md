# Deep Learning Workshop 2: Human Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors**

This project focuses on advancing **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using **time-series data** collected from wearable sensors. The primary objective is to classify human activities (e.g., walking, running, sitting) by leveraging both classical machine learning techniques and advanced deep learning models.By integrating feature extraction, self-supervised learning, and neural network enhancements, this project offers effective solutions for time-series classification.

The dataset comprises both labeled and unlabeled acceleration data, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating various machine learning and deep learning approaches. Key tasks include data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and experimentation with state-of-the-art techniques such as **1D-CNNs**, **autoencoders**, and **bidirectional LSTMs**.
